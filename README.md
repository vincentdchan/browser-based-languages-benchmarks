# Benchmarking Browser-Based Languages

This repo is a tools for benchmarking browser-based languages.
The main goal is to compare the performance of different languages that can be run in a browser environment.

Most the the benchmarks are based on the [The Computer Language
Benchmarks Game](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/).
I made some modifications to the original benchmarks to make them work in a browser environment.
